# Book-Search-Engine
A book search engine that can allow the user to create an account and save books they like into their own library. The user can likewise remove books later on from their library. My motivation for this project was to keep track of books that I want to read and when I am done I can remove them. This project helped me improve my skills in GraphQL as well as setting up a Heroku page and using MongoDB Atlas as the database.
